In the year 2010 my father asked me for a simple program to copy files from source directories to target directories. We evaluated several programs to do this job, but no one was simple enough, so I decided to code it self. Yesterday (November the 22th 2020) 10 years later my good old dad asked me to add a new button to this program. I didn't remember the program, so he sent me the executable. I was really surprised, that this program was still running and was still used by my father. The code was originally written in Visual Basic .Net 2005, used .Net Framework 2.0 and WinForms. With JetBrains dotPeek I was able to reconstruct a generated version of the program code in C#. 

Dad,
to be able to enhance this program in future, I created this repository and leave the source code of the new version here ...
